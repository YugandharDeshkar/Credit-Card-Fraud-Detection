# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
* Credit Card Fraud detection is implemented using anomaly detection algorithms like Isolation Forests and Local Outliar factoring.
* A sample of 28,000 credit card transactions (10% of total) is taken to reduce computation cost and personal details are hidden with PCA for privacy concerns.
* The models performed fairly well with 1.00 precision and 0.45 recall scores.
